* secret scanning howto
  In the github documentation, there is a mention that
  [[https://www.hyperscan.io][hyperscan]] is used to match the source text.

  The reference page [[http://intel.github.io/hyperscan/dev-reference/compilation.html#pattern-support][here]] mentions differences to pcre2, but the original man page
  is the reference.

  There are three patterns on the
  #+CAPTION: Security & analysis / Update pattern
  [[./img/secret-scan-config.png]]

  What is the order of evaluation for custom patterns; are they all put together
  in one pattern or are they sequentially evaluated in code?

  (before)expression(after) is evaluated first.
  next, before/after are stripped leaving what matched the expression, then
  must[not] matches are evaluated after.
